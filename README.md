# TwitterBot

This is a small project meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi 3 so the the bot can be up and running 24/7.
Functions of the bot include scanning Twitter for a keyword, sending direct messages, or updating its status to a random quote from a
dictionary. If you want to use this as a template for your own Twitter bot, just replace the keys in keys.py with your own API keys.
